## JavaScript Learning Project
This is a project I've been working on to learn and improve my skills in JavaScript.

It's a hands-on learning experience where I've been building a simple Rock Paper Scissors game and experimenting with different JavaScript concepts and techniques.

## Project Overview
The project includes a collection of small and scripts that showcase various aspects of JavaScript, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and more. 

The project isn't designed to demonstrate a specific JavaScript concept or skill, just my actual knowledge (04/24/2023).

## Goals
The main goals of this project are:

To deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and improve my proficiency in writing clean and efficient JavaScript code.

To practice problem-solving skills and learn how to approach and overcome coding challenges using JavaScript.

## How to play

-Open the "rock-paper-scissors" folder in your code editor and run the "index.html" file in a web browser.

-You will see a web page with three buttons: "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors".

-Click on one of the buttons to make your choice. This will trigger the JavaScript code that simulates the computer's choice and determines the winner based on the rules of the game:

Rock beats scissors

Scissors beats paper

Paper beats rock

-The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) will be displayed on the web page along with the choices made by both the player and the computer.

-The winner is the first to 5 points.

You can continue playing by clicking "play again" button after you win or lose the game.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript

HTML

CSS


## How to Run the Project
To run the project, you can simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the HTML files in a web browser. 

Or open the deployment in github pages: https://joaquintalice.github.io/RPSGame/

## Conclusion
This project has been a valuable learning experience for me as I continue to enhance my JavaScript skills. I've enjoyed experimenting with different JavaScript concepts and techniques, and building this game that demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. 

I hope that this project serves as a useful resource for others who are learning JavaScript as well. 

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and use the projects as a reference for your own learning journey. Happy coding!

Thank you for see my project.
